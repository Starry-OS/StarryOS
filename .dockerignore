# Docker build context for StarryOS
#
# Design:
# - Ignore everything by default
# - Then whitelist only what the Docker build actually needs
# The Docker build only needs:
# 1. docker/ folder (contains Dockerfile)
# 2. rust-toolchain.toml (needed to install Rust toolchain in Docker image)
# All other files are mounted via volume at runtime, so they don't need to be in build context.

# Ignore everything
*

# ---- Keep Docker-related files ----
!docker/
!docker/**

# ---- Keep Rust toolchain config (needed for Docker image build) ----
!rust-toolchain.toml
